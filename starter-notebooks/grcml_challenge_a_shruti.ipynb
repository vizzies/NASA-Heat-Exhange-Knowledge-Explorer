Wanko Tchatchouang1, X. Chi2 and T.I-P. Shih3  School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907  K.M. Bryden4 Ames Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Ames, IA  R. Ames5 and R.A. Dennis6 National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown, WV  Computations based on steady RANS with and without conjugate analysis were performed to study the effects of turbulence models in predicting the flow and heat transfer in a high-aspect ratio rectangular duct lined with a staggered array of pin fins with circular cross sections. The turbulence models examined are the shear-stress transport (SST) model and the stress-omega Reynolds stress model (RSM). In all simulations, the mesh was fine enough so that wall functions were not employed and integration of all equations is to the wall. Since RSM naturally accounts for streamline curvature, anisotropy of the Reynolds stresses, and the time-lagged response of turbulence to changes in the mean flow, predictions from RSM were used to assess the results from the SST model on the flow structure and surface heat transfer. Results obtained show how different models capture the key flow features created by a staggered array of pin fins  namely the horseshoe vortex at the pin fin-wall junction, the wake behind each pin fin, and their interactions  and how those flow structures affect surface heat transfer. Results are also obtained to show the differences in the predicted heat transfer coefficient with and without conjugate analysis.

Introduction   DVANCED gas turbines are designed to operate at increasingly higher temperatures in the turbine component to improve efficiency. The past increase in temperature operations has been enabled by progress made in  developing higher-temperature resistant materials and by developing cooling technologies that ensure all turbine materials that come in contact with the hot gases stay just cool enough to maintain strength and long service life. Today, the goal is to develop not only efficient gas turbines but also low-polluting ones so that more air is needed from the compressor for lean combustion in the combustor. As a result, the amount of air from the compressor available for cooling is greatly reduced. This reduced cooling flow imposes considerable challenge on turbine cooling designs. The new designs deviate considerably from the past design experience so that a lot of testing are needed to validate them. To accelerate the design process and to reduce the cost of design, physics-based tools that are rooted in first principles are needed to generate understanding on how design and operatin\n"

            "Effects of Turbulence Modelling in Predicting Flow and Heat Transfer in a Duct with Pin Fins  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics    1  Effects of Turbulence Modeling in Predicting Flow and Heat Transfer in a Duct with Pin Fins   C. Wanko Tchatchouang1, X. Chi2 and T.I-P. Shih3  School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907  K.M. Bryden4 Ames Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Ames, IA  R. Ames5 and R.A. Dennis6 National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown, WV  Computations based on steady RANS with and without conjugate analysis were performed to study the effects of turbulence models in predicting the flow and heat transfer in a high-aspect ratio rectangular duct lined with a staggered array of pin fins with circular cross sections. The turbulence models examined are the shear-stress transport (SST) model and the stress-omega Reynolds stress model (RSM). In all simulations, the mesh was fine enough so that wall functions were not employed and integration of all equations is to the wall. Since RSM naturally accounts for streamline curvature, anisotropy of the Reynolds stresses, and the time-lagged response of turbulence to changes in the mean flow, predictions from RSM were used to assess the results from the SST model on the flow structure and surface heat transfer. Results obtained show how different models capture the key flow features created by a staggered array of pin fins  namely the horseshoe vortex at the pin fin-wall junction, the wake behind each pin fin, and their interactions  and how those flow structures affect surface heat transfer. Results are also obtained to show the differences in the predicted heat transfer coefficient with and without conjugate analysis.

Introduction   DVANCED gas turbines are designed to operate at increasingly higher temperatures in the turbine component to improve efficiency. The past increase in temperature operations has been enabled by progress made in  developing higher-temperature resistant materials and by developing cooling technologies that ensure all turbine materials that come in contact with the hot gases stay just cool enough to maintain strength and long service life. Today, the goal is to develop not only efficient gas turbines but also low-polluting ones so that more air is needed from the compressor for lean combustion in the combustor. As a result, the amount of air from the compressor available for cooling is greatly reduced. This reduced cooling flow imposes considerable challenge on turbine cooling designs. The new designs deviate considerably from the past design experience so that a lot of testing are needed to validate them.
